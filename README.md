### About me
My name is Dino Gr≈æanov.
I'm a **Junior Developer** at [Prehnit](https://prehnit.hr/hr/) and currently pursuing **Master's degree** in Software Engineering at [FER](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/).
I consider myself a fullstack developer since I find frontend and backend equally interesting.

Some fields I find interesting include automotive engineering and geoinformatics.
