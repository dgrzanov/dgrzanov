### About me
My name is Dino Gržanov.
I'm a **Software Developer** at [Devōt](https://devot.team/) and currently pursuing **Master's degree** in Software Engineering at [FER](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/).
I'm a fullstack developer, but I find backend development more interesting.

Some fields I find interesting include automotive engineering and geoinformatics.
